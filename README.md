# Machine Learning Repository

Welcome to my Machine Learning Repository! This collection of code snippets reflects my journey in learning machine learning and mastering the effective use of the Scikit Learn library. To provide a structured approach, I have organized the repository into four distinct folders:

## 1. Data Analytics

Explore the realm of data analytics using the powerful Seaborn library. This folder houses code snippets dedicated to creating insightful graphs and visualizations to glean valuable insights from data.

## 2. Data and Its Processing

Delve into the intricacies of data preprocessing with a variety of code implementations. These snippets cover various preprocessing steps essential for preparing data before feeding it into machine learning models.

## 3. Supervised Learning

In this section, you'll find subfolders focusing on different aspects of supervised learning:

- **Classifiers:** Dive into the world of classification algorithms.
- **Ensemble Methods:** Explore the power of ensemble learning techniques.
- **Gradient Descent:** Understand the optimization process in machine learning.
- **Regressors:** Implement regression algorithms for predictive modeling.

## 4. Unsupervised Learning

Uncover the magic of unsupervised learning with code snippets dedicated to various algorithms, including:

- **DBSCAN:** Implement Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise.
- **K-means Clustering:** Explore the widely-used K-means clustering algorithm.
- **Fuzzy Clustering:** Understand and apply fuzzy clustering techniques.
- **Mean Shift Clustering:** Dive into mean shift clustering for grouping data points.
